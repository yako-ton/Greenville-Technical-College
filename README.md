# Greenville-Technical-College
These are some of the projects I have worked on during my time in the Associate's program for Greenville Technical College in Computer Technology - Data Science. I decided to take courses in data analysis/programming during my gap year to make me a better candidate for a Master's and PhD program in the near future. 


These projects are only shared for the goal of aiding other students in the future. If you are a student, I urge you to not just copy/paste any code I have shared. Education is an investment, you get more out of it the more you put in. You are wasting your money and time if you simply copy/paste from others without going through it yourself.
